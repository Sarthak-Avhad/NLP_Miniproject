# 🧠 NLP Mini Project – Text Cleaning & Preprocessing Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP) text preprocessing**.  
It demonstrates how raw textual data can be cleaned and transformed into a structured format suitable for Machine Learning and NLP models.

The notebook contains reusable Python functions to remove noise from text such as HTML tags, URLs, punctuation, special characters, and extra spaces.
